## Part 1 Introduction to FAIR data
Watch the [presentation](IntroToFAIRdata.pdf) on FAIR data given by [Erik van den Bergh](https://github.com/erikvdbergh)

### Exercises
Welcome to the first part of the FAIR data sprint exercises. In this exercise we will practice cleaning up data, to learn what is important to consider when making data FAIR.

1. First download the sample file [training_attendance.xlsx](Step1_DataCleaning/training_attendance.xlsx) and open in it a spreadsheet editor (Excel, Open/LibreOffice should all work fine, if not please let your instructor know).
2. Using the guidelines posted at the [Library Carpentries](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-spreadsheets/02-common-mistakes/index.html) create a new file with a cleaned up data set.
3. After cleaning up, results will be discussed plenary.

4. Next, go to the Library Carpentries [Openrefine lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/)
5. Before you start the exercise, make sure to [install Openrefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html) and downlad the [sample file](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-refine/raw/gh-pages/data/doaj-article-sample.csv)
6. Next follow the exercises on the Library Carpentries page. Results will be discussed plenary.

## Linked metadata
Watch the [presentation](IntroToLinkedMetadata.pdf) on Linked Data given by [Erik van den Bergh](https://github.com/erikvdbergh)

### Intro to SPARQL: Exercises
Follow the exercises in [Linked Metadata Exercises](LinkedMetadataExercises.md). The results will be discussed plenary.

### Applying Linked Metadata to Real life data

## Uploading to Repositories
Watch the [presentation](Repositories.pdf) on FAIR repositories given by [Erik van den Bergh](https://github.com/erikvdbergh).

### Repositories: uploading data
This is it! Using the skills you have obtained during the day you should be able to deposit FAIR data in a repository of your choice. Some good options are [B2SHARE](https://b2share.eudat.eu) or [4TU](https://data.4tu.nl/repository/). A domain specific repository can also be a good option such as the European Nucleotide Sequence Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena).

Remember the steps of today:
1. Clean data using spreadsheet programs or Openrefine
2. Optional: Link (meta)data using GraphDB
3. Fill in an upload request on your repository of choice and upload your data!

Remember to update the [FAIR data log](FAIRDataLog.md) of today once you are done!
