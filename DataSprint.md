### Exercises
Welcome to the first part of the FAIR data sprint exercises. In this exercise we will practice cleaning up data, to learn what is important to consider when making data FAIR.

1. First download the sample file [training_attendance.xlsx](Step1_DataCleaning/training_attendance.xlsx) and open in it a spreadsheet editor (Excel, Open/LibreOffice should all work fine, if not please let your instructor know).
2. Using the guidelines posted at the [Library Carpentries](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-spreadsheets/02-common-mistakes/index.html) create a new file with a cleaned up data set.
3. After cleaning up, results will be discussed plenary.

4. Next, go to the Library Carpentries [Openrefine lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/)
5. Before you start the exercise, make sure to [install Openrefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html) and downlad the [sample file](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-refine/raw/gh-pages/data/doaj-article-sample.csv)
